5.1 TECHNICAL INFORMATION
•	Why we select Ethereum Blockchain 
The blockchain of the Ethereum has a high technological level, it works very similar to Bitcoin, but above all the most important thing the blockchain consists of a series of blocks and each block contains a pointer to the previous block and an ordered list of operations. Blocks are secured by the proof of work, with a "long chain" (as defined by the total difficulty) by defining the set of committed transactions and order that must be processed. To get to the "current state" of the Ethereum blockchain, a node can start from the State of "genesis" (a common initial state that is included with each client from Ethereum) and process each transaction, any balance/sequence resulting from the application number code storage changes sequentially processing and code of execution of the transaction. The same process occurs in Bitcoin; Although Ethereum’ s emphasis on "transition state" of the execution of the transaction model is unique (for example, in Bitcoin, a transaction often philosophical is seen as an expense "outputs" from a previous operation in history, not in objects in the State), the way it works the code Ethereum, Bitcoin and other protocols such as Ripple, Dogecoin, etc., is essentially the same.
